# mfe-dependency-analyzer

Generate a simple report to understand the imports across your microfrontend application. The report generated by this tool should be used in conjunction with **mfe-dependency-aggregator** (still not created) to be able to identify and visualize dependencies across all microfrontends.

## Usage

- `yarn add -D mfe-dependencies-analyzer`
- Add script to package.json

      // to run manually
      "mfedeps": "mfedeps -f \"src/**/!(*.test|*.spec)js\""
      // OR execute after tests pass
      "posttest": "mfedeps -f \"src/**/!(*.test|*.spec)js\""

## Development

- `git clone --recursive https://github.com/filoxo/mfe-dependency-analyzer.git`
- `yarn install`
- `yarn --cwd mfe-deps-test-repo install`
- Execute locally

```sh
./bin/run -d mfe-dependencies-test-repo -f "src/**/!(*.test|*.spec).js" -r
# the quoted --files glob above is necessary to prevent some shell file expansion
```

### Testing

- Run `yarn test`

The tests use a hybrid of real files ([mfe-dependencies-test-repo](https://github.com/filoxo/mfe-deps-test-repo)) and virtual file fixtures. Here's how it works:

- [memfs](https://github.com/streamich/memfs) creates a virtual file system
- [unionfs](https://github.com/streamich/unionfs) merges real fs with virtual fs
- [mock-require](https://github.com/boblauer/mock-require) intercepts and uses the above vfs whenever native fs is called
- these are setup in `lib/fs.js` dynamically based on `MFE_DEPS_TEST_FS` environment variable. This was the only way I could find to extend fs within the command spawned by tests.
