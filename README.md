# mfe-dependency-analyzer

Generate a simple report to understand the imports across your microfrontend application. The report generated by this tool should be used in conjunction with **mfe-dependency-aggregator** (still not created) to be able to identify and visualize dependencies across all microfrontends.

## Usage

## Development

Run locally

```sh
./bin/run -f "src/**/!(*.test|*.spec).js" -n "@example/application" -r
```
